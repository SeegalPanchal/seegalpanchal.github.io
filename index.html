            Hi, I am a software developer from Guelph, 
            Ontario currently pursuing my bachelors in 
            Computer Science at the University of Guelph.
            I currently work at NCR as a developer for 
            the transaction processing team. Have a look 
            at some of the projects I have worked on over
            on the right, or you can contact me below.
