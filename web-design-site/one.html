        <h3>Linears vs Tactiles vs Clickies</h3>
        <p>
          Chances are, if you're interested in mechanical keyboards, you know the basic three switches: Cherry MX Reds,
          Cherry MX Browns, and Cherry MX blues. These switches are extremely popular and well known by even the most
          casual of mechanical keyboard owners. But what is the difference between these switches under the hood?
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Linear switches</strong> (Cherry MX Reds) are switches that do not have a click action, or a tactile
          bump. These
          switches are smooth on the downward stroke, and are often used for gaming applications, to achieve fast
          presses.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Tactile switches</strong> (Cherry MX Browns) are switches that do not have a click action, but do have
          a tactile bump. These switches are initially heavy to press, but after passing the tactile bump, become
          smooth, akin to a linear switch. The bump at the actuation point allows you to 'feel' when the switch is
          pressed, giving you a more feedback, and is great feature for an avid typist.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Clicky switches</strong> (Cherry MX Blues) are switches with a tactile bump, as well as a click
          action. These switches are similar to a tactile switch, but also have a click action at the tactile bump,
          giving the user sound feedback to indicate the keypress was successfully registered.
        </p>

        <h3>Cherry MX Red</h3>
        <p>
          Cherry MX Reds are the king of gaming switches. Popularized by keyboards such as the Corsair K65, this is a
          linear switch with a low actuation force and no bump, allowing for fast, precise clicks when playing games.
          The lack of a bump also greatly assists the switch in gaining users outside of gaming- the silent, no click
          design, being highly sought after for normal work.

          <h3>Cherry MX Brown</h3>
          <p>
            Being another option for the Corsair K65, Cherry Browns found themselves rocketing to popularity. Achieving
            a subtle, yet satisfying tactile feel, the switch is very popular as an alternative for gamers who also
            desire feedback when typing. The switch is only slightly heavier than Cherry's linear offering, but provides
            a more rounded experience.

        <h3>Cherry MX Blue</h3>
        <p>
          Cherry Blues are extremely divisive among the mechanical keyboard community. Providing substantial audible
          feedback on each click becomes quite annoying to your fellow coworkers and classmates. Despite this, the
          switch is extremely popular, becoming available during the advent of the consumer mechanical keyboard market,
          the switch still sees wide use today.

        <p>Now you know what the difference between the main switches are. However, there are many, many more options
          you should seriously consider if you are on the market for buying switches. The most premium switches on the
          market are names you most likely have never heard of: Holy Pandas, Cannon Keys Lavenders, and even Cherry MX
          Blacks. Always be on the lookout for what switch will specifically suit your own taste.</p>
