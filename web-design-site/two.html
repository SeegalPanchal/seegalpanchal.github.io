        <h4>Plastic vs Aluminium</h4>
        <p>
          When discussing mechanical keyboards, we must first decide on the quality of build we want. Many in the
          enthusiast community prefers aluminium, but I would argue the choice is not so simple. There are factors
          beyond price that we should consider, when deciding between the two.
        </p>
        <h4>Plastic</h4>
        <p>
          Plastic keyboards, expectedly, are cheaper than aluminium boards. Consumerism tells us that aluminium is
          better, because its more expensive, but the choice is not so simple. Consider the following pros/cons:
        </p>
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Pros</th>
            <th>Cons</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Cheaper</td>
            <td>Prone to scratches</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Lighter</td>
            <td>Moves around on desk</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Deeper sound signature</td>
            <td>Less sound variety</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <p>While we can continue listing more pros and cons (we haven't even touched hollowness), the idea is
          straightforward: plastic is not perfect, but it
          does come with its own set of benefits. Anyone who wishes for a deep sounding board that they can travel with
          should seriously consider a board made from plastic.</p>
        <h4>Aluminium</h4>
        <p>
          Aluminium boards come with a hefty price tag, and often times, they may not be worth it. But who am I to put a
          price tag on satisfaction? Expensive boards are often CNC-machined, are incredibly high quality, and built to
          last. These boards are the epitome of luxury typing.
        </p>
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Pros</th>
            <th>Cons</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>High quality build</td>
            <td>Expensive</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Stable on desk</td>
            <td>Heavy and difficult to travel with</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Large sound variety</td>
            <td>Default higher sound signature</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <p>Aluminium boards have a hefty price tag attached to them- but to some, they are worth every penny. Sleek
          build quality, combined with clean, consistent sound, is a dream for anyone who types for extended periods of
          time.</p>
        <hr>
        <h4>KBDFans KBD67 Lite</h4>
        <p>The KBD67Lite is the board this site was typed on. Featuring a plastic build, the sound is deep and muted,
          the board is light and maneuverable, and the typing is bouncy with its gasket mount design. The board comes
          with a variety of fixins and foams which helps elevate the sound to a higher level.</p>
