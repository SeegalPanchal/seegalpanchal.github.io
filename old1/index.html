									<b>Abstract/Introduction</b> 
									<br> 
									NCR is an American based software and technology company. The company has produced a variety of products focused on enhancing consumer and retail payment solutions. While they are not widely known to consumers, retailers often use their products; you might notice that many debit/credit machines you use are typically branded as NCR. The office in waterloo focuses on processing transactions created by a consumer at a bank, aiming to enhance not only the consumer experience, but also employee productivity. 
									<br>

									<br>
									<b>Information about the Employer </b>
									<br>
									As briefly mentioned above, NCR Waterloo focuses on enhancing consumer and employee experience for banking. I was a part of one of the multiple agile development teams belonging to the TxFoundation group. My role on the team was mainly assisting full time developers and taking on any roles needed by the team. During the first few months, I took the time to understand the codebase and get myself up to speed and handle any tasks given to me more fluidly. Simply attempting to learn the code interactions inside the project helped me understand how complex a product can get, despite what seems simple at a higher level. This was apparent when making a change in one part would result in an error being thrown from a completely different microservice. My role in the team shifted during the 2nd term, as the QA was moved to the other team, allowing me to experience not only development, but also investigate the relation between the business side of the product, and the codebase and how to test for the final product rather than simply testing invalid inputs. Additionally, throughout both my terms at NCR, working in an agile team gave me exposure to working as part of a team and helped develop my ability to communicate with different people. 
									<br>

									<br>
									<b>Goals - Term 1</b> 
									<br>
									During my first work term, my goals were centered around understanding and working with the codebase that was given to me. My first two goals concentrated on understanding the technology  stack used, and the interactions between these different softwares. These goals gave some direction for the area I wished to focus my learning on during the first few months. My third goal focused on my soft skills, specifically my ability in communicating with others. While I’m not sure whether I consider this goal completed, as I still believe there is more room to grow, I do believe I improved vastly during my time at NCR. My fourth goal was more of a challenge; I would give myself some time after every problem before I would ask for help, allowing me to understand and attempt a solution before obtaining the solution from my coworkers. This goal gave me insight into why some problems exists and allowed me to understand the solution at a better level. My final goal was one designed to set me up for future work: understanding the time takes to get a problem, then design and implement the solution. Understanding the time it takes to complete your work is an incredible asset, allowing others to schedule around you more efficiently. My schedule was still wonky in term 1, but I believe this goal had much more improvement during term 2. 
									<br>
									 
									<br>
									<b>Goals - Term 2</b> 
									<br>
									My goals in term 2 were designed to give me room to explore the product. My first term was focused on understanding why the product was the way it is; my second term is about understanding flaws and why the product should be changed. To begin, my first goal was to join the coding standards committee and understand any mistakes others developers may have made, as well as getting a first hand account of the proposed solution. I joined the standards committee, and my conversations with my coworkers from other agile teams allowed me to learn the reservations in the style of coding done at NCR. My 2nd goal was focused on using the extensive functionality of git. During my first term, I noticed a weakness of mine; during one of my sprints, I was asked to revert one of the files. I couldn’t figure it out and I ended up just redownloading that specific file. However, after learning git through online tools, I now have a much deeper understanding of version control, which will assist my greatly in my future endeavours. My final goal was to learn documenting the changes you make to the product, to see how to word your code changes to those who have not seen the implementation. There were more hiccups here, although I did get more experience in this regard. 
									<br>

									<br>
									<b>Achievements</b> 
									<br>
									During my time at NCR, the company hosted a global hackathon. I partnered with three other coops and worked outside my responsibilities to develop an app using ReactJS and Microsoft Azure (which I can unfortunately not speak additional details of as it is intellectual property of NCR). We were fortunate enough to advance into the global finals, beating out nearly 400 teams, and as a result, we received a monetary reward for our placement. 
									<br>
									
									<br>
									<b>Conclusions</b> 
									<br>
									In conclusion, I learned a lot at NCR. Personally, my biggest take away from NCR was soft skills, as well as working on a product with many different people. I also gained experience in workflow and developed my technical knowledge immensely. I will always be grateful for my time at NCR. 
									<br>
									
									<br>
									<b>Acknowledgments</b> 
									<br>
									My acknowledgements go out to my team who worked with me and brought my up to speed, not just as someone working at NCR, but as an employed developer working for a company. I’d like to personally thank everyone in Delta (who will not be named for the sake of privacy)..</p>

									<b>Abstract/Introduction</b> 
									<br>
									CaseWare is an accounting/audit company that creates software for accounting professionals, businesses and governments. While the software CaseWare has created is important, my tenure on the DevOps (Developer Operations) team did not delve into production grade software, but rather on the pipelines which allowed developers to work and execute their code smoothly. 
									<br>

									<br>
									<b>My Work at CaseWare</b>
									<br>
									At CaseWare, I was employed as a DevOps Intern. My role on the team was helping out completing the backlog of tasks built up for the operations team. During my first few months, I was involved in developing an application that acted as a frontend for Github's API. This was created as an internal tool to be used temporarily until GitHub updated the functionality of their pipelines. This tool was used to create more specific permission sets to allow certain parties to execute but not modify pipelines, as well as authorize runs but not have access to repos. Due to having some prior experience with Python web development, I was able to smoothly transition into my work. The project allowed me to focus on integrating into the team rather than learning the intricacies of a new software kit. Additionally, by using software that I was familiar with, I was able to learn more about pipelines and infrasture setup at CaseWare; giving me valuable experience in CI/CD at a large company. My work then diversified into other aspects that focused more heavily on AWS. I got exposed to IAC (infrastructure-as-code) such as Terraform, and AWS resources that were created as a result, such as S3, EC2, Lambdas, and more. I learned that the product was deployed on EKS clusters, and that we used technologies such as Flux, to deploy to these clusters. My focus during this part of my term was more diversified, where I ended up learning more, but implementing less than I initially though. During the last few months of my term, my focus tightened again as another major initiative was launched, which I assisted with. This initiative created a far more effective pipeline which allowed developers to test their changes without merging their code into the master branch. My final bit of work at CaseWare was package migration, a proposal to transfer maven and NPM packages to another github repository. Due to the many limitation on GitHub, this was much more difficult than expected, and I learned a ton of typescript and functional programming practices to assist on this.
									<br>

									<br>
									<b>Goals - Term 1</b> 
									<br>
									During my first work term, similar to my previous terms at NCR, I centered the goals around understanding the work done at CaseWare, as well as integrating into my team. Due to the unique circumstances of these terms (remote working), I had to figure out how to familiarize myself with my team when our only encounters would be during meetings. As such, my goals were oriented towards this new type of working. My first goal was working efficiently with my team using google meets as my only point of contact- which I quickly acclimated to. Additionally, I learned that many members of my team were shy/quiet, and as such I would often try to start conversations less focused on work to reduce friction caused by our unfamiliarity. My other goals were focused on my work, such as the many tools used at CaseWare (Bamboo/GitHub/Jenkins/Django/...) which I got exposed to due to co-ops being treated as full time devs (sans access to Production environments), and time management, which I achieved by recording blockers that I ran into and accounting for it when discussing new tickets.
									<br>
									 
									<br>
									<b>Goals - Term 2</b> 
									<br>
									During my second term, I wanted to continue my focus on time management. However, this time, I changed my focus from just managing my own time, to filling in my managers daily on the work I did. I learned from my manager that he would give me a task and I would later come back with it finished, but he was interested in getting more updates before it was done as well. As such I started commenting my progress on Jira. My other goals focused specifically on pipelines and on call. During my first term, while I learned of the different technology at CaseWare, I didn't actively change anything that would be considered pure devops work. I was more focused on the GitHub front end project. Since this initiative was ending, I thought this would be a good time to shift focus to more infrasture tasks that operations typically handles. Luckily, there was a new initiative being done which allowed me to learn about developer pipeline work. By assisting with this project, I felt I learned a ton of how to setup proper continuous development and delivery than at any of my previous terms/school. My final goal was related to on-call work done- as part of the operations teams, sometimes deployments have issues, and there were oncall rotations for the operations team. The work was typically very diverse, and it allowed me to learn of common issues that may occur, as well as standard practices of operations team members who have issues past a common 9-5 shift.
									<br>
									
									<br>
									<b>Conclusion</b> 
									<br>
									In conclusion, I ended up learning far more at CaseWare than I did at any other job. There was always a ton of great work being done, and due to the decades of development, I was exposed to a wide variety of softwares that the developers had attempted at using. In comparison, the product I worked on at my previous job was much newer, with a tighter focus on the technologies used. Additionally, I thoroughly appreciated the forward thinking of all the employees at CaseWare, if there was a better way of doing something, they would always attempt to improve on their work and advance.
									<br>
									
									<br>
									<b>Acknowledgments</b> 
									<br>
									I'd like to a throw a shout out to the entire operations team at CaseWare. The people who work on the team are all extremely competent developers with an incredible work ethic. Learning their backgrounds and witnessing their work ethic was a large motivator during my time there, as well as my future goal to pursue postgraduate studies.
